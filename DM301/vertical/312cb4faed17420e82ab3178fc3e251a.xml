        <description>&lt;p&gt;Censorship in the Libraries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' --Katherine Paterson, Author&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Write a persuasive essay for a newspaper reflecting your views on library censorship. Do you believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to certain groups? Support your position with convincing arguments from your experience, observations, and/or reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Read for conciseness, clarity of thought, and form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
