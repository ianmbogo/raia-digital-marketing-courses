<p>Welcome! We have created this introductory course so you can learn how to use the platform and how to take a class on it.</p>
<p>You will find that chapters or sections organize the course. Initially, you will learn how the platform is composed and how you can navigate through it. Then, you will find examples of the different types of content you can find in a course, the variety of activities and questions an instructor may ask you to do, how you can interact with other students, and finally, how to view your progress in the course and access the certificate, if the course offers one.</p>
