<p>As we told you previously, at some point in your courses, you may encounter an essay writing exercise where you will have to respond in writing to a specific topic that will appear in the prompt of this section. </p>
</div>
<p>You, your classmates, the staff-course, or all of them can review these essays, so you may also have to check your classmates' texts. Your professor will create a rubric to help the class review the papers. </p>
<p>Below is an example of this exercise where you can learn how to use the system by telling us what your favorite food is and what we should try, but it is supposed to be reviewed by a peer and by you, so you will not have feedback initially. The importance is to learn how this tool might work. </p>
