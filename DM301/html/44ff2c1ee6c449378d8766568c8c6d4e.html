<p>To start, you must understand how the content will be organized on the platform. Each course is divided into <strong>sections, subsections,</strong> and <strong>units</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Sections</strong> are the chapters of the course. For example, this course has five sections. Each section will be divided into one or more subsections.</li>
<li>The <strong>Subsections</strong> are like the subtitles of each chapter and are made up of units.</li>
<li>Each <strong>Unit</strong> is a content page with text, videos, forums, and different activities. For example, this page is a unit that is part of the first subsection of the first section of this course.</li>
