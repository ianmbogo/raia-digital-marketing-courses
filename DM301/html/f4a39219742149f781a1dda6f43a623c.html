<p>When you are working on a course, you can check your progress in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green Check Marks:</strong> When you complete a subsection, there will be a green check mark next to it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Progress Page:</strong> If you click the <strong>Progress tab</strong> in the navigation bar, you will access the <strong>Progress Page,</strong> where you will find the course completion percentage, the percentage of the passing grade, and the details of every grade in the course. Here you will have in detail all the information about your performance in the course.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each course has its percentage cutoff for passing grades. You can see where those cutoffs are by looking at the <b>Grades</b> sections. In this particular course, a "pass" is considered 60%. When you "pass" a course, you might receive a certificate after the class has closed.</p>
<p>Sorry - this course does not grant certificates, but your other courses might do.</p>
