Some students and professors engage through social media, such as Facebook groups.</p>
<p>Recent research has found that if you take a class with a friend or engage socially with other learners while taking a course, there is a higher likelihood that you will complete a course. If you haven’t already, consider finding a study buddy!</p>
<p>Check out more information about the discussion forum, navigating to the next item in this learning sequence. In the discussion forums, remember to be polite and respectful. Simply put, treat others the way you want to be treated.</p>
<p>Another essential part of learning is interacting with your peers while doing the different activities on your course, like in the Open Responses Answer when you have to review their essays or receive feedback.</p>
