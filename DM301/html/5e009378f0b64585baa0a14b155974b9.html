<p style="text-align: left;">Your course might be set up to issue certificates as evidence that you completed the course. Different types of certificates might be available for courses you take.</p>
<p>In case a course has a certificate, after the last assignment in a class has been due, you will see the entry in your student profile change to show progress toward generating your certificate. You can download the certificate from your profile page after completing the certificate generation process.</p>
