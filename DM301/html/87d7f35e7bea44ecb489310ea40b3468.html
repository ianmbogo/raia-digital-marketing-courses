<p>Your professors could ask you to upload a file to respond to a particular activity. For example, imagine that your class is about design, and your instructor asks you to upload a simple logo design for a company you are creating. It could be in a PDF, .jpg, or .png format.</p>
<p>To do so, click the <strong>Upload your assignment</strong> button and select the file. Once uploaded, you must click <strong>Submit</strong> to send your file for review.</p>
