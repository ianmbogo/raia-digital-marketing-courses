These labs are customized to each class and subject area. We have collected examples of the more popular lab environments to experience and play with, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mathematical expressions.</li>
<li>Chemical equations.</li>
<li>Electrical circuits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please be patient with yourself as you look around at these lab environments. You don't have to answer all the questions, but you get a good idea of how the labs and demos work.</p>
