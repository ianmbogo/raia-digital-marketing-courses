<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Some questions will give you more than one chance to answer. </span>Occasionally, you might submit a correct answer and continue experimenting with possible solutions. That is great! Exploring all possible correct answers is a very effective way to learn. However, you should remember to leave your final response with a green check mark next to it. The platform system will only count your most recent answer towards your final grade, so if your extra experiments leave your answer incorrect, you will not get credit for the problem.</p>
