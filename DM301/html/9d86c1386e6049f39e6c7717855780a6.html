<p>In your courses, you will also find interactive content allowing you to engage differently with the information. For example, you can crouse your way with data visualization.

<p>Here is a visualization of data held by the World Bank on the world population between 1960 and 2018, segmented in a geopolitical division.Â Each circle represents a country, and hovering over each one will display the total population of that country. You can also use the timeline at the bottom of the map to visualize the information for each year or even activate the animation to see the population development during those years.</p>
