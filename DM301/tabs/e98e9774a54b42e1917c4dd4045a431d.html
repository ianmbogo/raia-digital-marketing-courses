Subject: Final Remarks %%COURSE_DISPLAY_NAME%%

Dear %%USER_FULLNAME%%,

As we near the end of %%COURSE_DISPLAY_NAME%%, we want to take a moment to congratulate you on your dedication and hard work throughout this learning journey. Your commitment to expanding your knowledge and skills has been truly commendable.

We hope you have found the course content engaging and valuable and are leaving with a deeper understanding of course subjects. Completing a course is a significant achievement, and we are proud to have had you as a part of our learning community.

* If you qualify for a certificate (overall score to pass or higher), the
  dashboard will include a link to your certificate soon.
  While you may see the link in a few days, it can take up to two weeks for
  the platform to generate all of the course certificates.

* As an enrolled student, you can access the lecture videos 
  after the course ends. Assessments will remain, but you can no longer submit answers to any problem sets or exams with due dates.

* The discussions close on %%COURSE_END_DATE%%. You will not
  be able to add to the discussions after that time, but you will be able to
  continue viewing all of the conversations that took place during the
  course.

Once again, congratulations on your accomplishment, and we wish you all the best in your future endeavors. Keep learning, exploring, and growing.
